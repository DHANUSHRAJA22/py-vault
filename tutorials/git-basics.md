## ðŸ“Œ Best Practices

* Always create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b my-feature`)
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Use `git pull --rebase` to avoid unnecessary merge commits
* Use `.gitignore` to exclude unwanted files



## ðŸ“‚ Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your forked repo to your local machine
3. **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature-name`
4. Make your changes âœ…
5. **Stage & commit** your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Added feature"`
6. **Push** your branch: `git push origin feature-name`
7. Create a **Pull Request** from GitHub
