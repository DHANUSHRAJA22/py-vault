File Backup Script

Usage:
    python file-backup.py <filename>

Description:
    This script takes a source file path as a command-line argument,
    and creates a backup copy by appending `.bak` to the original filename.
    Example: mynotes.txt ‚ûù mynotes.txt.bak

Note:
    - The backup will be placed in the same directory as the original file.
    - If the file does not exist, it will print an appropriate error message.
